6. Wrapper Object

7. Comparison operator
The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions. The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. It's this case where === will be faster, and may return a different result than ==. In all other cases performance will be the same.

8. Explain event delegation
event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes(many children node), instead, the event listener is added to one parent

9. Explain this keyword
function's this keyword behaves different in JS compared to other languages.
in most case, the value of the this is determined by how a function is called.

10.
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value

null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value

11 Immediately-invoked function expression IIFE
An IIFE is a JS design pattern which produces a lexical scope using JS's function scoping
(function() {//code
}())


12 Explain AJAX in detail
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
AJAX allows web pages to update asynchronously by exchanging small amount of data
with the server, so it's possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading
